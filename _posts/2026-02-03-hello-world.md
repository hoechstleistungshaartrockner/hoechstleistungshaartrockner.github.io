# Hello World

Welcome to my personal blog! I will be sharing my thoughts and experiences here, as well as tutorials, tips, and resources on various topics I find interesting. That's right, it's a blog! Much wow.
Generally, I am interested in programming, web development, crafting things with my hands, music, art and technology.
There is really no specific theme to this blog, I just want to write about whatever I find interesting at the moment, although I have the feeling that I will use it to rant about programming related stuff quite often. Let's wait and see!
